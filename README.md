# My random Python stuff
All the Python stuff I managed to create in about a week

You may be confused why there's nothing here. Good point. It's all in branches. The singlefile branch is for as it says, python that doesn't require other files.

The pyterm branch is for PyTerm (may just create a separate repo), and salesbuster is for the game Sales Buster
